Final Project #
## Team He ##
## Application: Dialect Dictionary ##
## Spring 2020 ##
## Overview ##
Our application is a platform that aims to share the knowledge and charm of different dialects to the world. The application allows users to record their own dialect as well as learn dialects from others. According to our design, all words in different dialects will refer to the same object which is connected by one unique image of that object. This way, the users can easily understand the words and have a connection without knowledge on any standard languages. The purpose of this platform is to protect the historic heritage of dialects which are facing the challenge of extinction nowadays. We will solve this problem by providing a convenient and straightforward way for users to share and learn them. We hope that this platform can also be a compliment for traditional dictionaries, which normally have the data for standard languages only. The application will allow users to upload an image, the spelling, the standard language, pronunciation, and location of the word.

## Conclusion ##
The team found that the design and implementation process was challenging but doable. We learned a lot through the design and implementation process because most of us had no experience in html, css, javascript, and typescript. We had experience in database queries because we took Compsci 345 but did not know how to integrate a SQL database to our backend. The in-class exercises were very helpful starters to implement our PCRUD server and SQL database queries. Some challenges we faced were deploying everything on Heroku and getting our server to connect up with our data model with the user interface.
