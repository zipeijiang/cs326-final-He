## Innovative Idea ##
Our application is a platform that aims to share the knowledge and charm of different dialects to the world.
The application allows users to record their own dialect as well as learning dialects from others.
All words in different dialects will refer to the same object which is connected by one unique image of that object so that users can easily understand the words and have a connection without knowledge on any standard languages. 
The purpose why we want to build this platform is to protect the historic heritage of dialects which are facing the challenge of extinction nowadays, by providing a convenient and straightforward way for users to share and learn them. We hope that this platform can also be a compliment for traditional dictionaries, which normally have the data for standard language only.

The application will use google map to identify the location of users, which is uploaded by users themselves, to indicate where the dialect comes from. And the application will use a standard language dictionary, such as google translation, to connect dialects with the definitions in their corresponding words on standard languages. 
## Important Components ##
### 1.The application will allow users to create accounts to upload the data. 
To help regulate the origin of users' dialect, first-time upload dialect user will be asked to create account. While guests won't require an account to acces the conetent but they can have their own accounts to memorize the dialect they've seen.  

### 2. Upload data require specific fields to fill.
When the user uploads a word that first time appears in the database, they will ask to upload an image of the object the word describing, a video file for the pronunciation, the spelling (optional), and the city the user lives in by google map. If the user wants to upload a word describing an object on an image that exists in the database, they will upload the same thing expect for reusing the existing image. Another function of the application allows users to upload the word describes the image on standard language, and this description is allowed to be modified by any users for accuracy.

### 3."Favorite" button and comment function.
There will be functions that allow user interaction: Users can "like" the word uploaded by other users just like Twitter, and if necessary, they can comment on the word.

### 4.Search function
The application allows searching on standard languages, on dialects if the user knows the spelling, and on the location (city, province, or state, country) if users want to learn the dialect in certain places.
