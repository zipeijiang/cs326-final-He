## Innovative Idea ##
Our application is a website that collects words in dialect over the world. This application allows users to record their own dialect as well as learning others' dialects. All words in different dialects that refer to the same object are connected by one unique image of that object so that even users without knowledge on any standard languages can use this website to upload their data. The purpose of this application is to protect dialects, which are facing the challenge of extinction, by providing a convenient and straightforward way for users to record and study them. This application is also a compliment for traditional dictionaries, which normally have the data for standard language only.

The application will use google map to identify the location of users, which is uploaded by users themselves, to indicate where the dialect comes from. And the application will use a standard language dictionary, such as google translation, to connect dialects with their corresponding words on standard languages and their definitions.
## Important Components ##
The application will allow users to create accounts to upload the data. When the user uploads a word that doesn't exist in the database, they will need to upload an image of the object the word describing, a video file for the pronunciation, the spelling (optional), and the city the user lives in by google map. If the user wants to upload a word describing an object on an image that exists in the database, they will upload the same thing expect for reusing the existing image. Another function of the application allows users to upload the word describes the image on standard language, and this description is allowed to be modified by any users for accuracy. 

There will be functions that allow user interaction: Users can "like" the word uploaded by other users just like Twitter, and if necessary, they can comment on the word. The application allows searching on standard languages, on dialects if the user knows the spelling, and on the location (city, province, or state, country) if users want to learn the dialect in certain places.
